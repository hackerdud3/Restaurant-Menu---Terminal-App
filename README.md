# Restaurant-Menu---Terminal-App
I developed a c-program which shows menu(LIST of food items) and user can select food to eat. Food has calorie and price. When user selects for a particular food item it showers valid coupons on that order, the user can apply a coupon code on it to avail discount on the price depending on the discount percentage. I used to files, menu.txt and discount.txt, the food items and corresponding coupon codes are read from the file.
